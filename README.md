# instagram-easy-wall
This is a small-minimal Wordpress plugin to load the photos from an owned Instagram account.
It requires an access token from Meta and (free) application on facebook apps, to get the access token you need the user and password of that account.

Pictures urls are stored locally with transient to avoid large number of calls.
